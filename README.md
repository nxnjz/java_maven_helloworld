  `mvn compile`
  + This will run Maven, telling it to execute the compile goal. When it’s finished, you should find the compiled .class files in the target/classes directory.
  + Since it’s unlikely that you’ll want to distribute or work with .class files directly, you’ll probably want to run the package goal instead:

`mvn package`

  + The package goal will compile your Java code, run any tests, and finish by packaging the code up in a JAR file within the target directory. The name of the JAR file will be based on the project’s `<artifactId>` and `<version>`. For example, given the minimal `pom.xml` file from before, the JAR file will be named gs-maven-0.1.0.jar.

**java -cp target/jb-hello-world-maven-0.1.0.jar hello.HelloWorld**
